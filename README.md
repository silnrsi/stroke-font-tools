# stroke-font-tools

This is an experimental repository for python-based tools to manipulate stroke-based font sources. _Nothing here is guaranteed to work or not to break in the future!_ As the tools mature they are likely to be moved into the larger [pysilfont](http://github.com/silnrsi/pysilfont) package.

The tools require a variety of other libraries, including [fontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools), [beziers.py](https://github.com/simoncozens/beziers.py), [fontParts](https://github.com/robotools/fontParts), and pysilfont. A separate repository - [font-stroke-test](http://github.com/silnrsi/font-stroke-test) - contains a font used in testing these tools and others.
